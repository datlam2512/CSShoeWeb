        <p>SolePalette.nl works with Mollie's secure internet payment system to process the payment of an order. All payments are made in a secure environment. At the SolePalette.nl webshop you can pay with:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>MoMo</li>
            <li>Paypal</li>
            <li>Credit card</li>
            <li>Apple Pay</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Do you use a bank transfer payment? Then the delivery time is 2 to 3 days longer, because it takes longer for the money to be received.</p>
        </p>
    </div>
