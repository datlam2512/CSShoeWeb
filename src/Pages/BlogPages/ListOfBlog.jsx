      "As the weather cools in the Northern Hemisphere, it becomes the ideal climate for marathon season. With the Berlin Marathon happening this upcoming weekend, adidas have something big in store. A new race day shoe will retail for a whopping $500.The adidas ADIZERO Adios Pro Evo 1 has been thoroughly tested at the adidas HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany as well as in real life settings in Kenya, with marathon winners and Olympic champions providing insights and feedback to create the racing shoe.The ADIZERO Adios Pro Evo 1 is the lightest racing shoe adidas have ever created. It sits at a cruisy 138 grams, making it 40% lighter than any other racing shoe they’ve created. The ADIZERO Adios Pro Evo 1 also uses a new forefoot rocker system to improve running economy and trigger forward momentum, making you faster and more efficient at the same time. adidas have also implemented a new iteration of Lightstrike Pro, which uses a new manufacturing process to help make the midsole lighter and provides better energy return.The translucent upper reflects the lightness of the sneaker, as the Three Stripes are placed boldly on the lateral and medial sides, falling down into the midsole. The outsole is placed strategically to cut down weight while still providing traction.The adidas ADIZERO Adios Pro Evo 1 is set to drop on September 26, 2023 via the adidas App, retailing for $500.

    content:
      "The Air Jordan 4 doesn’t sleep! Throughout the past six months, Jordan Brand have been heavily pushing Michael Jordan’s fourth signature silhouette, blessing it with crisp colourways like the ‘Frozen Moments’ and even allowing a Nike SB rework. Now, with the ‘Thunder’ retro in our rearview mirrors, a leaked look at a new colourway has just arrived, and it’s been dubbed ‘Medium Olive’.Rumours of an olive-toned Air Jordan 4 have been circling for what feels like a year now, but only recently have images started surfacing. Constructed under the Craft banner, the ‘Medium Olive’ boasts full-suede uppers, utilising nappy and smooth materials. Interestingly, the lateral and medial wings have been constructed of black leather, and the usual netting found on the sides and tongue has been replaced with patterned suede.",

      "The terrace revival is well and truly in full swing, and adidas are contributing to the hype with their State Series. Following on from the Massachusetts release comes the ‘Beaver’ iteration that pays homage to Oregon.The state is known for its scenic landscapes and lush forests, but it is of course most famously associated with beavers, hence the nickname ‘The Beaver State’. The name originated during the settling of Oregon when beavers were hunted for their pelts to make the oh-so fashionable fur hats.",

    content:
      "While the Air Jordan 1 High OG has always been a hit, it took a long time for the low-cut version to get the love its currently receiving. Now with the Lows being just as popular as the Highs, an OG 1985 colourway makes its way to the Air Jordan 1 Low OG later this fall, with some tweaks.While the ‘Metallic Red’ colourway is from 1985, it wasnt until 2015 that it hit the Air Jordan 1 Low OG. Similar but different, white leather is used on the majority of the upper and University Red is seen on the Swoosh and heeltab, opting for tumbled leather instead of patent leather. In OG form, Nike branding is used on the tongue tag with the Wings logo stitched on the heel, and a white midsole and University Red outsole finishes off the sneaker.",

    content:
      "If there’s one sneaker that’s been wearing the hype crown for the past couple of years, it’s the Dunk. In recent times, the Dunk craze shot to unprecedented levels, with the heritage hooper becoming the most sought after silhouette around the world. The hype became so widespread that it saw newcomers brought into the fold, sparked some fans to obsess even harder, and inspired others to box away their pairs.It was when I got excited about the potential 2024 OG Dunk retros that I noticed it felt like the dust had finally settled on the Dunk hype. With trend followers locking their sights firmly on the adidas Samba, its safe to say the Dunks hype title has been succeeded to the terrace sneaker, along with that slight ‘cringe’ factor that comes with following the crowd. With more OG Dunks being brought back into the fold next year, I’m officially ready to bring them back into my daily rotation. But how did we even get here",
